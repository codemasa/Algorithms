This is the dynamic programming solution to the Longest Common Subsequence.

For example:

X: ABCBDAB
Y: BDCABA

The length of the LCS is 4
LCS are BDAB, BCAB, BCBA

Sub Problems of LCS:

* This uses strings X[0..n] and Y[0..m]

1) When the 2 strings end in the same character:
  LCS(X[0..n], Y[0..m]) = LCS(X[0..n-1], Y[0..m-1]) + X[m] if X[n] = Y[m]

2) When the 2 strings end in different characters:

  case 1:
    if the LCS ends in X[n] then it cannot end in Y[m] thus we have
    the strings X[n] and Y[m-1]

  case 2:
    if the LCS ends in Y[m] then it cannot end in X[n] thus we have
    the strings X[n-1] and Y[m]
